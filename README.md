## Data Cleaning 
After loading the data into the MySQL
database, I began the data preparation
process, keeping my desired insights in mind.
Here is a more detailed explanation of what I mean:
- Loading the data into the MySQL
database:** This is the first step in the data preparation process. It involves
transferring the data from the original
source (in this case, Kaggle.com to the
MySQL database.
- Data preparation: This is the process of
cleaning, transforming, and enriching the
data so that it is ready for analysis. This can involve a variety of tasks, such as removing duplicate data, correcting
errors, and adding new information.

## Data Modeling 
After outlining the data in the tables to make it easier to analyze, I loaded it into Power BI for visualization and modeling. I created relationships between the tables where needed using the primary and foreign keys to make it easier to filter the results.

## Data Visualization 
After modeling the data, I created an
interactive dashboard with bookmarks and
page navigation buttons to allow users to
switch between different dashboards and
pages within the report.

First i created a cover Page to show what the report is about.

Then created a general view of the data.

Then created separate visuals for the Top 10 Female and Male Billionaires, youngest
billionaires and Top philanthropist.
